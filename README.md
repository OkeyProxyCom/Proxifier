# Why Do You Use Proxifier?

The main reason to use a proxy client like Proxifier is to route all your internet requests through a proxy server. Without a proxy client, proxies can only be used with applications that support proxy usage natively. Many client applications, especially those developed by web services that don't support proxies, lack this capability.

These applications can bypass your default proxy settings and reveal your real IP address to web services. If you want to prevent these applications from exposing your IP address, the best solution is to use a proxy client that intercepts your internet requests and directs them through the specified proxy server.

Upon launching, Proxifier takes control of all network connections within the system.

The captured network connections are processed according to the rules configured in Proxifier.

"Direct" allows direct access to the external network.

"Proxy" routes the requests through a proxy server before connecting to the external network.

"Block" intercepts and prevents outgoing requests from being sent.
